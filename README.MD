## My blog on GitHub

To document my journey as a Java Developer I keep a [blog](https://geertjan-kuip.github.io/) with an update every few days. I write about coding problems I encounter, solutions I find, things I learn and accidental milestones. 

During the process of learning for _Java SE 11 Developer_ I used the blog as a way to store notes, including code samples, on the learning material. 

Generally, the blog illustrates how my understanding of Java concepts has evolved since December 2024. You can read the posts [here](https://geertjan-kuip.github.io/) or you can open the folder [_\_posts_](https://github.com/GeertJan-Kuip/GeertJan-Kuip.github.io/tree/main/_posts) to view them.
