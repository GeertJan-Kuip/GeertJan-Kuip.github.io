## My blog on GitHub

To document my journey as a Java Developer I keep a [blog](https://geertjan-kuip.github.io/) with an update every few days. I write about coding problems I encounter, solutions I find, things I learn and accidental milestones. 

During the process of learning for Oracle Certified Professional: Java SE 11 Developer I used the blog as a way to store notes, including code samples, on the learning material. 

Generally, the blog illustrates how my understanding of Java concepts has evolved since December 2024.
