## Classes in Javascript

Currently I'm working on a Javascript single page pet project (soon to be presented here) and I'm using classes. I love them.

The benefit here not only is that my code looks more structured and organized, coding becomes easier as well. In earlier days my code was made up of long lists of functions referencing each other in rather complex ways, which tended to make programming somehow mentally exhausting. Not anymore.

Right now I create classes and give every class its own file. The classes serve no other purpose than organization and readability. I'm not planning to create inherited- or meta classes, I'm not planning to reuse code and I don't worry about naming conflicts or polluted namespaces.

It is purely about having things well-organized and that is just great.
