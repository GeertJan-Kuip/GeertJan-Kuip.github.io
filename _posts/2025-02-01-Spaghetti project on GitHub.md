## Spaghetti project on GitHub

My pet project named 'Spaghetti' is on [GitHub]<https://github.com/GeertJan-Kuip/spaghetti> in an open repository. I tried to publish the project a bit more orderly than my [previous project]<https://github.com/GeertJan-Kuip/learning-javascript>, at least by writing a better readme and by being more disciplined when doing commits. Every commit does one thing, whether cleaning code or fixing a bug, so it is clear how one version is different from the next.

While I used GitHub desktop in my javascript projects, for this I used Intellij's in-built functionality. It surprised me how fast JetBrains had access to my account. Kuddos to GitHub.

Few things:
- code on GitHub looks more serene on GitHub than in an IDE, thanks to limiting color use, smaller font and increased line height. Even bad code looks good this way.
- I might need to explain more about the required dependency (the SQLite driver), although you can just read pom.xml.
- I want to upload the JAR file for if someone might to see the program in action without having to compile it.

One more thing: I was a bit overwhelmed by all the options under the GitHub actions tab. I'm not gonna pay attention to it for now.
