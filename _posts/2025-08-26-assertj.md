# AssertJ

AssertJ is the open-source library for assert statements that are helpful in test classes. The basic module you need to import is Core and the basic import you do is `import static org.assertj.core.api.Assertions.assertThat;`. 

Besides the Core module there are special Guava, Joda Time, Neo4J, DB and Swing modules that require separate pom dependencies and imports.

## Maven dependency

This is the Maven dependency to add:

```
<dependency>
	<groupId>org.assertj</groupId>
	<artifactId>assertj-core</artifactId>
	<scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
```

It is included in spring-boot-starter-test as a transitive dependency so often you can take the import for granted.

## Documentation

There is very good documentation on [https://assertj.github.io/doc/](https://assertj.github.io/doc/). There are also javadocs on [javadoc.io](https://www.javadoc.io/static/org.assertj/assertj-core/3.27.3/index.html). Package org.assertj.core.api is the important one, and in this package class [_AbstractAssert<SELF extends AbstractAssert<SELF,ACTUAL>,ACTUAL>_](https://www.javadoc.io/static/org.assertj/assertj-core/3.27.3/org/assertj/core/api/AbstractAssert.html) is the first one you might want to see.

This AbstractAssert class contains all methods that can be used on object types, like _has()_, _is()_, _isEqualTo()_. while the subclasses contain methods appropriate for the specific subclass. AbstractAssert is the parent of many subclasses that are specialized in specific object types.
