## Debugging in Intellij

On YouTube I watched a video of a C++ game developer telling how he had learned to program and what he would do differently if he had to do it all over again. One thing he regretted was not using a debugger in the earlier stages of his development. 

Inspired by his story I tried Intellij's debugger for the first time. It was not an immediate succes but I think I can do better with setting breakpoints and adding conditional statements to them. I might need to add dummy variables or some additional lines of code as well. Actually I want it to work, because it might save huge amounts of time, making me more productive.

To be continued.
