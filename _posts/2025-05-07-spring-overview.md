## Spring overview

There is no real alternative to learning Spring as a Java developer. According to ChatGPT, Spring Certified Professional from Broadcom/VMWare is the #1 course to follow. It is easier than 1Z0-819 and it costs about the same. As obtaining my Oracle certificate was, because of its difficulty, a rewarding experience, I think I'm gonna get this one too. To get the same level of difficulty I will need to give myself a tight schedule.

### Typical questions

I asked perplexity what the contents of Spring Certified professional are and she came with this:

- Spring Core: Dependency Injection, Bean lifecycle, Java and annotation-based configuration, component scanning, profiles, and properties.
- Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP): Pointcut expressions, use of annotations, proxy-based vs. AspectJ weaving.
- Data Management: Spring JDBC, transaction management, Spring Data, and integration with databases.
- Spring MVC & REST: Web and REST application development, controllers, request mappings.
- Spring Security: Authentication, authorization, method-level security, and configuration.
- Spring Boot: Auto-configuration, properties, Actuator, testing with Spring Boot, and advanced testing tools.
- Testing: Unit and integration testing, use of @SpringBootTest, @MockBean, @WebMvcTest, etc.

I asked some examples of questions and this is what I got:

- Which annotation is used to define a bean in Java configuration?
- What is the effect of setting readOnly=true in the @Transactional annotation?
- Which properties are required to configure an external MySQL database in Spring Boot?
- How does component scanning work in Spring?
- What is the difference between @Mock and @MockBean?

There seems to be enough material to find to prepare for this exam, to be continued.
