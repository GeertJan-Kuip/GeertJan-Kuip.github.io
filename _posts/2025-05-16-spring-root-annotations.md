## Spring root annotations

The Spring framework kind of overwhelms me, there being so many ways to do the same thing without much overall structure guiding my thinking. One thing where this happens is with the annotations, of which there are a great many. 

My thought was that it might be better not to learn every annotation as a separate thing but to learn the composition/inheritance trees. Actually very similar to Java classes, where for example a ton of collection classes can be understood by knowing a set of basic interfaces like Map, List, Deque etc. 

### Root annotations

I asked ChatGPT to provide a list of all Spring annotations that do not have a Spring meta annotation, ie they do not inherit behavior from another Spring annotation. With this list, is the idea, you can compose all other annotations (whereby it is possible that these other annotations show behavior that cannot be explained purely by their meta annotations, although I would hope the makers of Spring are somehow rigorous in this).

Anyhow, the list:

#### Core Stereotype Annotations

- *@Component* - Marks a Spring-managed component (bean)
- *@Repository* - Specialized component for persistence layer
- *@Service* - Specialized component for service layer
- *@Controller* - Marks a web MVC controller

#### Core Configuration Annotations

- *@Configuration* - Indicates a configuration class
- *@Bean* - Marks a method as a bean producer
- *@Import* - Imports additional configuration classes

#### Dependency Injection Annotations

- *@Autowired* - Automatic injection of beans
- *@Qualifier* - Distinguish between multiple bean candidates
- *@Value* - Injects values from properties
- *@Primary* - Indicates a preferred bean when multiple candidates exist

#### Web

- *@RequestMapping	Maps HTTP requests to handler methods
- *@RequestBody* - Binds HTTP body to method parameter
- *@ResponseBody* - Binds method return value to HTTP response body
- *@PathVariable* - Binds URL path segments to parameters
- *@RequestParam* - Binds query parameters to method parameters
- *@ModelAttribute* - Binds form data to model objects
- *@ExceptionHandler* - Handles exceptions thrown by controller methods
- *@CrossOrigin* - Enables CORS support on controllers


#### Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP)- *@Aspect* - Defines an aspect class

- *@Before, @After, @Around, @AfterReturning, @AfterThrowing* - Advice annotations

#### Transaction Management 

*@Transactional* - Manages transaction boundaries (Note: may have some internal meta-annotations, but generally treated as base)

#### Scheduling

- *@Scheduled* - Marks scheduled methods

#### Testing

- *@TestExecutionListeners* - Registers custom listeners that hook into the test lifecycle
- *@TestPropertySource* - Provides property overrides for integration tests
- *@ContextConfiguration* - Loads a Spring application context for testing
- *@DirtiesContext* - Marks the context as "dirty" after the test â€” it will be reloaded
- *@IfProfileValue* - Conditionally run tests based on active profiles
- *@Repeat* - Runs the same test multiple times

#### Web Testing

- *@WebAppConfiguration* - Declares that a WebApplicationContext should be loaded for the test

#### Transactional Tests

- *@Rollback* - Indicates whether the test transaction should be rolled back after the test
- *@Transactional* -  is shared between core and test modules and isn't strictly test-specific.

#### Others

- *@Scope* - Defines bean scope
- *@Lazy* - Lazy initialization
- *@PostConstruct and @PreDestroy* -  (Java standard, not Spring)
