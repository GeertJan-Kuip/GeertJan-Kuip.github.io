## Talking with the recruiters

It's a little more than two weeks ago now that I started my journey. Since then I have talked, among others, to two recruiters about possibilities and opportunities. 

One of them works for a company that offers two-year contracts to non-IT graduates. This 2-year period kicks off with an 8 week bootcamp, after that you work as a low-salaried junior for a Dutch top 200 company. The other one was more of a regular recruiter.

I learned a few things:
- recruiters call and mail you back and are pleasant to talk to
- there's always some hard-to-fulfill vacancy requiring a special combination of skills
- doing the bootcamp trajectory is risky, at least with my age
- my experience in 3D might be handy

With regards to the second point, the regular recruiter had a job opening at a company in the medical sector, requiring C++ and 3D experience. Sure, it's a typical profile for game developers, but otherwise I don't know about the relative scarcity of this profile. At least I am halfway with it.

About the bootcamp trajectory: I'm a bit old and thus harder to sell. Because you signed the contract with the recruiting company, they will have to pay you for the full period and if you want to terminate, you need to pay back the bootcamp costs.

Funny thing: after I spoke with the recruiter of the bootcamp company, a YouTube advertisement started to show up starring that same recruiter, talking about how interested they were in new talent. I have never been targeted so hard.
