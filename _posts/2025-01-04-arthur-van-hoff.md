## Arthur van Hoff

I had never heard of Arthur van Hoff until I found his name, first on Wikipedia and later on as an author somewhere in the Java library code. It turns out he is Dutch and he is named as the author of the Java 1.0 compiler.

Python was always extra cool because it was created by a dutchman, Guido van Rossem. Having a dutchman as an important figure in Java history makes Java a bit cooler as well.
