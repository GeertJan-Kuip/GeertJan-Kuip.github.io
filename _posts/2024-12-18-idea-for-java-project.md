## Idea for Java project 

Ok, this is the Java pet project I'm going to make. It's a desktop application that reads the files of a Java software package via its Git folder and generates all sorts of analysis and quick-to-scan materials about that project. Think of:

- the project timeline, growth of the codebase
- the names of packages, classes and methods within
- all imported modules plus info on which methods and classes are being deployed
- all commentary in the files as a sort of readable stream
- the global variables, their types and names
- the readme, license and other non-code documents

The goal is twofold. First I want to create a big, scalable project that forces me to organize things properly. Second, by developing a tool that helps me to quickly scan the codebases of open source projects I learn a lot about the structure and syntax of good projects made by others. To be continued.
