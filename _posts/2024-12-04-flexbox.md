## Flexbox

I do not aspire to be a great UI designer, mainly because I'm sure other people have more talent for it.

Nevertheless, because my pet projects need interfaces, I had to create one and I discovered Flexbox. That worked really well. Things have gotten easier since the days I struggled with it 13 years ago.

Actually I have nothing to say about Flexbox, it just did the job. From Youtube I learned that often 'grid' is a better option for more complex designs, but I wonder if i will ever need that.

That's it. UI design is not my thing but fortunately there is Flexbox.
