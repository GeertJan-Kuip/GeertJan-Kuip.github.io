## Reading code 

To improve my Java knowledge I need to read good code and I'm gonna try to start with it soon. I already googled for it and found some better known GitHub repositories.

Glancing over the .java files, I was surprised how much boilerplate code was part of those codebases. Many files mainly seemed to consist mainly of extensively annotated variable declarations and initializations. I didn't find complex algorithms.

Of course, I might have looked in the wrong files, and I looked only briefly. I will find out once I get more serious about this. Will be continued.
