## Cheat sheet 1Z0-819

This is a new format I will try with collapsable sections. In this post I will summarize [the book](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08DF4R2V9/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_d_asin_title_351_o00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) with a lot of specific on all the topics. For now I'll foolow the chapter order of the book, but it is a work in progress.

<summary>Chapter 1: Welocome to Java</summary>

### Learning about the Java environment

- JDK contains compiler (javac), launcher (java), archiver command (jar) and API documentation (javadoc) command
- javac generates bytecode
- java launches the JVM before running the code
- JVM runs the bytecode .class files
- In Java context, API's are classes like StringBuilder that are built in and can be used

### Identifying benefits of Java
- Object oriented
- Encapsulation
- Platform independent
- Robust (garbage collection, no memory leaks)
- Simple (simpler than C++)
- Secure (because it runs inside JVM)
- Multithreaded
- Backward compatibility
