## Passed Java 11 certification

This morning I successfully passed the Oracle Java SE 11 Developer 1Z0-819 exam. The required score was 68% and that was what I exactly had. The badge is on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/geert-jan-kuip-95387630).

It is a [little more than four months ago](https://geertjan-kuip.github.io/2024/12/17/JAVA!.html) that I started learning Java, and this is what Oracle think the badge is worth:

_Candidates who hold this certification have demonstrated proficiency in Java (Standard Edition) software development recognized by a wide range of world-wide industries. They have also exhibited thorough and broad knowledge of the Java programming language, coding practices and utilization of new features incorporated into Java SE 11. By passing the required exam, a certified individual proves tremendous fluency in Java SE and acquisition of the valuable professional skills required to be a Java software developer. This includes a deep understanding of object-orientation, functional programming through lambda expressions and streams, and modularity._

### A rewarding experience

Learning for this exam, which I started in february, was in fact a joy and to me all the topics seemed relevant. I indeed feel very thoroughly educated in the basics of Java. Inheritance, polymorphism, scope, functional programming, generics, concurrency, exceptions, modular applications, i/O and NIO.2, JDBC and security were all in it. I have learned, more than I would otherwise would have, to think as a compiler.

### Learning materials

The most important learning material I used was the book "Oracle Certified Professional Java SE 11 Developer Complete Study Guide Exam 1Z0-815, 1Z0-816, and Exam 1Z0-817." The book is a few years old and the title might seem to be misleading but Oracle has combined some previous exams at different levels into one new exam that covers them all. The authors Jeanne Boyarsky and Scott Selikoff have done a terrific job. The text is crystal clear, the review questions are difficult enough to keep you humble and in my experience the exam was completely in sync with the book. As far as I can recall there were no questions on the exam that the book hadn't covered.

I also bought their other book, "Oracle Certified Professional Java SE 11 Developer Practice Tests." This book has tons of test questions on all topics, including 4 practice exams covering everything in 50 questions, and it is just good, although I spent much more time in the study guide. 

In the week before the exam I also bought the [Enthuware](https://enthuware.com/) mock tests, you pay around 12 dollar for access to around 1000 test questions that you take online. The good thing here was that the questions were challenging, the explanations were well formulated and helpful, and the experience (doing a set of 50 questions covering the whole spectrum with the possibility to mark them, revisit them etc) very much emulated the real test. 

The last thing I had were online tests from [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/java-se-11-developer-1z0-819-ocp-course-part-1/?couponCode=ST8MT220425G1). I did one or two tests of them, a bit similar to Enthuware, with slightly easier questions. In the week up to the exam I had scores of around 55% on the mock exams of Enthuware and those of Jeanne and Scott, and a 66% on a Udemy exam. Nevertheless, for a price of 10 or 15 euros it is great value. You might also argue that the mock exams were I got 55% were slightly too difficult (although I don't think so).

more to come..
