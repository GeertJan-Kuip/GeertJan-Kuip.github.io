##What language to learn

When I started three weeks ago I was quite sure I would specialize in either Python, Java or C++. Now I'm not so sure anymore.

Recently I talked to a team lead in a relatively young company. They make Software as a Service and Javascript is their language, which surprised me. I still thought of Javascript as a relatively minor tool unsuited for serious backend stuff.

Over the last week I have dived into modern Javascript and it made me a sort of believer. It actually does great backend things, more than I ever thought it would.

I'm not sure with what specialism I will end up, but Javascript is on my list right now.
