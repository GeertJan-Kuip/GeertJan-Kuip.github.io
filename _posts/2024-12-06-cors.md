## CORS

In my current, soon to be released pet project, I decided to include fetch() to import some content from some other website, more specifically from Mozilla Developer Network. I got an error.

In the past I have been using Python to scrape websites and I remember it went well, although I forgot which problems I encountered let alone how I solved them.

The current problem has to do with my browser not allowing cross origin requests, and I might solve it by adding the right headers. There might be blockades on the Mozilla server side as well but I'm still ignorant about that.

Nevertheless, I learned that I don't know enough about headers and web protocols, so my goal is to learn everything about them. To be continued.
