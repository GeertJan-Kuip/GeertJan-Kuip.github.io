# Mermaid

I was looking for ways to draw uml-like graphs and stumbled upon [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/#/). According to its website, it is a:

_"JavaScript based diagramming and charting tool that renders Markdown-inspired text definitions to create and modify diagrams dynamically."_

According to [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/creating-diagrams) you can use it on GitHub pages, using ``` style codeblocks. Example:

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A-->B;
    A-->C;
    B-->D;
    C-->D;
```

The style is declarative, I suppose it won't work on my official blog page [https://geertjan-kuip.github.io/](https://geertjan-kuip.github.io/) as that one has its own plugins.
