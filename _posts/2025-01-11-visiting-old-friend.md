## Visiting old friend 

Yesterday I visited a neighbour friend of my childhood, we hadn't met for years but this was fun. He is a senior web developer for a large publisher, and back in the days he was an avid Commodore 64 explorer. Since then he has worked in Pascal, C, Perl, PHP and Javascript/React. As a hobby he likes to program all sorts of sensors and is capable of connecting those to whatever network.

We talked for hours, a bit about family stuff and a lot about software/hardware. I learned he is a fan of PHP, which for him is the perfect tool to connect frontend and backend. He programs in Vim, is a virtuoso with command prompt, and can explain in detail the architecture of the Commodore 64 chip. It was inspiring, we meet again.
